But I know it won&amp;rsquo;t work (actually it is true), I come to similar issue before, did a fix for it, but seems it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work.
The real down time was not long, performance recovered to some degree soon, but latency was still high, not normal. I monitored it for long time, and tried to find out the root case until morning. Since traffic was growing when peak hour coming, performance became problem again."/>

Finally, impact was mitigated, and I&rsquo;m working on a long term solution. I learned some important things from this accident.</p>
<h2 id="the-outage">The outage</h2>
<p>I received alarms about live performance issue at 3am, first is server latency increaing, soon some service&rsquo;s health check failed due to high load.</p>
<p>I did following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Check monitor</li>
<li>Identify the problem is caused by KV system</li>
</ol>
<p>Okay, problem is here, I know the problem is KV system&rsquo;s performance issue. But I can&rsquo;t figure out the root case right now, I need a temporary solution.
Straightward way is redirect traffic to slave instance. But I know it won&rsquo;t work (actually it is true), I come to similar issue before, did a fix for it, but seems it doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>The real down time was not long, performance recovered to some degree soon, but latency was still high, not normal. I monitored it for long time, and tried to find out the root case until morning. Since traffic was growing when peak hour coming, performance became problem again.</p>
<p>I decided to upgrade the server to a large tier with more cpu cores, since the problem is caused by high cpu usage. After it, latency back to normal, at least users won&rsquo;t feel anyting unusual, but KV server&rsquo;s cpu usage is still high, so the problem needs more inspectation.</p>
<p>In the following working day, I worked on investigating the root case. And finally figured out the problem is caused by a lot of keys in KV expired at the same time. And the underlying storage engine can&rsquo;t hanle this condition well. I&rsquo;m working on migrate KV system to another one(AWS DynamoDB).</p>
<h2 id="review">Review</h2>
<p>There is something I did wrong when reviewing this accident.</p>
<p>Our campany&rsquo;s original KV system is hosted by redis (with AOF enabled), but the total size is limited by RAM, and data size grows quickly, can&rsquo;t fit in RAM anymore. So I need to migrate to a disk based choice, and I perfer to migrate a system compatible with redis protocol, then I needn&rsquo;t change live code and migrating data will be simple.</p>
<p>After investigating several choices, I choosed current one, since its compatibility is best. I came to several bugs when testing, reported it to author,he fixed it very quickly (really appreciated). The reason why I didn&rsquo;t migrate to DynamoDB is also migration effort is big, although I must do it now. When running on live, performance is great, but I came to crash issue sometime, the author also fixed it. Looking back today, I feel it&rsquo;s too bugy, and I should consider migratition earlier. The codebase is too large and I&rsquo;m not familiar with C++, every time came to bug, I can&rsquo;t figure out the root case indenpendently.</p>
<p>When reviewing my process of handling outage, I&rsquo;m lack of mitigation solution, most thing I can do is just waiting and monitoring.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>When choosing core technology, we should be more careful, not only considering the migration effort, but also backup, recovering, monitor and outage handling.</p>
<p>So the right process if handling outage is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Notice the problem (receive alerm).</li>
<li>Reponse to it quick. (Let team know I&rsquo;m handling it)</li>
<li>Migitation, make business back to normal. (Maybe fail over to slave)</li>
<li>Cleanup and fix previous workaround.</li>
<li>Postmortem.</li>
</ol>
