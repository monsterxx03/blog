      <description>Recently, we build pub/sub system based on AWS&amp;rsquo;s SNS &amp;amp; SQS service, take some notes.
Originally, we have an pub/sub system based on redis(use BLPOP to listen to a redis list). It&amp;rsquo;s really simple, and mainly for cross app operations. Now we have needs to enhance it to support more complex pubsub logic, eg: topic based distribution. It don&amp;rsquo;t support redelivery as well, if subscribers failed to process the message, message will be dropped.
There&amp;rsquo;re three obvious choices in my mind:
 kafka AMQP based system (rabbitmq,activemq &amp;hellip;) SNS + SQS  My demands for this system are:
 Support message persistence. Support topic based message distribution. Easy to manage.  The data volume won&amp;rsquo;t be very large, so performance and throughput won&amp;rsquo;t be critical concerns.
I choose SNS + SQS, main concerns are from operation side:
 kafka need zookeeper to support cluster. rabbitmq need extra configuration for HA, and AMQP model is relatively complex for programming.  So my decision is:
 application publish message to SNS topic Setup multi SQS queues to subscribe SNS topic Let different application processes to subscribe to different queues to finish its logic.  SQS and SNS is very simple, not too much to say, just some notes:</description>
